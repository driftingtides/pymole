PyMole
============

This is a wrapper for the LazyMole console application (Rizzo & de Barros, 2017). With this package you can create a LazyMole model with numpy array inputs for the hydraulic conductivity, source and target fields (must have same dimensions) and run LazyMole. Post-processing of results has not been completed yet
